BUGS

- Need to add '_power_plant' to all not ppg
	- This is fine for multipliers as well, since there isn't more than one type of plant for each type of power
- Need to change ppg to 'planetary_power_generator'
- Need to make any other changes in regards to naming (I think mines and storage are ok as-is)
- Need to change ui.js and planet.js to account for:
	- Naming convention changes
	- Change of some instances of power(level) to power(type, level), as well as cost / production, etc
		- Also, change from 'level, type' to 'type, level' if applicable
